# noesis-rk-plugin
A [Noesis](https://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91) plugin for My Little Pony Gameloft .rk files

You can use this by putting [fmt_rk.py](fmt_rk.py) in the `plugins/python` folder in your Noesis installation folder.

In order to load textures, you need the model in the folder containing the `.rkm` and `.pvr` files.

The original script was made by [Durik256](https://github.com/Durik256/Noesis-Plugins/blob/master/fmt_rk.py), this is just a modified version that makes sure the textures are loaded correctly.
